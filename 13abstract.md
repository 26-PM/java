An abstract class in Java is a class that serves as a blueprint for subclasses and cannot be directly instantiated itself. It acts as a way to define a general concept and enforce specific behaviors on its subclasses. Here are some key points about abstract classes in Java:

Declaration: An abstract class is declared using the abstract keyword before the class keyword.
Abstract methods: An abstract class can contain abstract methods. These methods lack an implementation (body) and are defined with just the method signature.
Subclasses: Abstract classes are meant to be extended by subclasses. These subclasses inherit the abstract methods and must provide implementations for them before they can be instantiated.
Concrete methods: An abstract class can also have concrete methods with complete implementations. These methods can be used by subclasses directly.
Benefits of using abstract classes:

Code reusability: By defining common functionalities in the abstract class, subclasses can inherit and reuse them, reducing code duplication.
Polymorphism: Abstract classes enable polymorphism, allowing you to treat objects of different subclasses but of the same abstract class type in a uniform manner.
Enforced behavior: Abstract methods guarantee that subclasses implement the required functionality.
Here's an example of a simple abstract class Shape in Java:

Java
```
abstract class Shape {
  public abstract double getArea(); // Abstract method
  
  public void printArea() {
    System.out.println("Area: " + getArea());
  }
}
```
Use code with caution.

This Shape class defines an abstract method getArea that subclasses like Circle or Square must implement to provide their specific area calculation logic. The printArea method is a concrete method that can be used by all shapes.

I hope this explanation clarifies abstract classes in Java!
